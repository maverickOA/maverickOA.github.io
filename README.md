# Titanic Dataset Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to uncover insights related to passenger survival rates during the Titanic disaster. By exploring various factors such as class, gender, and age, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the demographics and circumstances that influenced survival.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including demographics, class, ticket fare, and survival status.

## Methods

1. **Data Cleaning and Regularization:**
   - Initial cleaning and regularization were performed using R. This involved handling missing values, transforming variables, and structuring the dataset for analysis.
   - Further cleaning and organization of the dataset were done in Excel, refining the data for visualization and analysis.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards, facilitating the exploration of relationships between different variables and providing clear visual representation of insights derived from the data.

## Key Insights

1. **Class and Survival Rate:**
   - Passengers in higher classes had significantly higher survival rates compared to those in lower classes, attributed to the greater availability of lifeboats for First Class passengers.
  
2. **Gender and Age:**
   - Female adults and children had higher survival rates, reflecting the "women and children first" protocol followed during evacuation.

## Target Audience

This project's findings are valuable to historians, data scientists, and enthusiasts interested in maritime history and survival analysis. Additionally, educators and researchers studying historical events and their impacts can benefit from these insights.

## Applications

The insights derived from this analysis can be used to understand the social and logistical dynamics of the Titanic disaster. They can also serve as a reference for improving safety protocols in modern maritime and transportation industries. Furthermore, this project showcases effective data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques.

## Conclusion

By leveraging R, Excel, and Power BI, this project provides a detailed analysis of the Titanic dataset, uncovering critical insights about passenger survival. The findings highlight the influence of socio-economic status and demographic factors on survival rates, contributing to a deeper understanding of one of history's most infamous maritime tragedies.
